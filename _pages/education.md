I am currently a senior student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu), enrolled in the [3+2 engineering program](https://sites.uci.edu/engr32/) under the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Prior to this, I completed the first three years of my undergraduate studies at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), with the first year (Aug 2021 - Jul 2022) in [the School of Economics and Management](https://em.seu.edu.cn) and the second and third years (Aug 2022 - Jul 2024) in [the School of Artificial Intelligence](https://cse.seu.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Mofei Song](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/smf/index.html), within [PALM Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/home.html). I was an exchange student at [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu) in the winter of 2023, guided by [Prof. Bruce Huang](https://scholar.harvard.edu/brucehuang/home). I was a research intern at [the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn) in the summer of 2023, with [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/) and [Dr. Haoqiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DyD-6M8AAAAJ) within [FIB Lab](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn).
