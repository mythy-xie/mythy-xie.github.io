I am currently a senior student at the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/eecs), [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu). I am completing my senior year studies and research at UCI through [3+2 Engineering Program](https://sites.uci.edu/engr32/). I have finished the first three years of my undergraduate study (2021.08-2024.07) at the [School of Artificial Intelligence, SEU](https://cse.seu.edu.cn). During this period, I achieved excellent academic performance and gained extensive research experience. I participated in several practical projects and was selected for the school’s 'Elite Engineer' class. I have received multiple academic scholarships and won awards in various competitions. My research has been published in journals including *IEEE TVT*, and I have been invited to serve as a reviewer for journals such as *China Communications*. 

**I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2025 admission, with interests in AI-related fields. I welcome any recommendations or connections and look forward to contributing to a collaborative research environment.**

Research Interests
======
My currently research interests are in the area of 
- AI methods for science;
