Education
======
* Ph.D or M.S. in ..., ..., 2025.09-... (expected)
* Joint Education Student in Computer Science, [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu), 2024.08-2025.06
* **B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence**, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), 2021.08-2025.06
* Exchange Student in Data Science Program, [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu), 2023.01-2023.02

Research Experience
======
* *Aug 2023-Now* : Feature Point Extraction for SLAM Semantic Fusion
  * [PAttern Learning and Mining(PALM) Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn), School of Artificial Intelligence, Southeast University
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Mofei Song](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/smf/index.html)
  * This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems through advanced feature point extraction techniques. By integrating semantic information into the SLAM framework, we aim to improve the robustness of feature matching and facilitate better understanding of the environment. The project involves developing algorithms that leverage deep learning and computer vision methodologies to identify and extract meaningful feature points from sensor data. (Collaborated with X. Lin, J. Shi and others)
 
* *Jun 2023-Now* : Research on Communication Issues in Urban Science
  * [Future Intelligence laB(FIB)](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University
  * Supervisors: [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/) and [Dr. Haoqiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DyD-6M8AAAAJ)
  * The project cooperated with ZTE and China Mobile to explore and gradually implement urban scenario applications in Beijing International Trade Zone, such as the deployment of communication base stations and MIMO system parameter optimization, and achieved leading technical standards by using **deep reinforcement learning** technology. I took part in completing several sub topics such as communication coverage optimization, base station deployment strategy, MIMO system parameter optimization, urban edge computing, etc.

* *Oct 2022-Aug 2023* : Unsupervised deep representation learning and application
  * [PAttern Learning and Mining(PALM) Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn), School of Artificial Intelligence, Southeast University
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Yuheng Jia](https://jyh-learning.github.io/index.html)
  * In this research, I investigated the theoretical foundations of unsupervised deep representation learning, focusing on the principles that enable effective feature extraction from unlabelled data. I analyzed existing algorithms and conducted innovative applications to demonstrate their practical utility. Through experimentation, I evaluated the performance of various techniques in tasks such as clustering and anomaly detection, contributing to a deeper understanding of how unsupervised learning can address real-world challenges.
